Feature: Job service integration tests
    The Job service is responsible for executing scheduled actions on various targets.

Scenario: Query for job items

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure account service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 50    |
    Given Account
      | name      | scopeId |
      | account-a | 1       |
    And I configure account service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Given Account
      | name      | scopeId |
      | account-b | 1       |
    And I configure account service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Then I select account "account-a"
    And I create 10 job items
    Then I select account "account-b"
    And I create 20 job items
    When I query for jobs in account "account-a"
    Then I get 10
